 - Just unzip and load ./index.html
 - There is a separate documentation page with a browser-support table
 - There is a separate unit tests page with QUnit
 - To test on my smartphone I uploaded it to an apache server.
 - documentation => ./doc/index.html
 - unit tests => ./qunit.html

ACKNOWLEDGMENT

 - After completing the puzzle and stepping back, from a usability point of view,
   I see this improvement to be done : Not having to click "Start" button every
   round. Just automatically enter another round until the user stop interacting
   (no click actions nor mouse movement, then it would stop). Having to click
   "Start" everytime is not the most user-friendly way if you are going to play for
   an hour !
 - In a release I would have a build node script to call RequireJS Optimizer (r.js)
   to minify CSS and compress JS.
 - With the help from graphic designer I would put nice illustrations of Paper, Rock
   and Scissors.
